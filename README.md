## 📊 How It Works

### For Users

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Connect your Web3 wallet to the platform
2. **Deposit Collateral**: Add assets to your vault as collateral
3. **Borrow Assets**: Borrow against your deposited collateral
4. **Manage Positions**: Monitor health factors and manage your positions
5. **Earn Rewards**: Stake tokens in savings vaults to earn rewards

### Key Concepts

- **Collateral**: Assets you deposit to secure your loans
- **Health Factor**: A metric indicating the safety of your position
- **Liquidation**: When health factor drops too low, positions may be liquidated
- **Savings Vaults**: Lock tokens for specific periods to earn rewards
